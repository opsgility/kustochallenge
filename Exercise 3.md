# Challenge Guide

## Challenge 3: Visualizing KQL results
 
Now that there is a listing of errors and metrics, its now important to make it easily interprative to the client and assist in the diagnostics with visualizations.  Generate visualizations graphing the source clients' addresses of the issue as well as what type of browser they're using.  Also, include a graph indicating the Azure resources that encountered these errors.

Also, have a coorelating time line graph to indicate the number of errors in the given time frame of the errors.  Place all of these graphs on a common dashboard or report to allow for quick review and correlation.

## Success criteria

Demonstrate to your coach:

- Bar graph of client IP's as well as one of the Azure resources involved
- Pie chart of client browsers
- Timeline of errors for web services
- Dashboard or report listing all the graphs in a single view

## Progressing to the next challenge


After you have completed the challenge and reviewed with your coach you can continue to the next challenge.
